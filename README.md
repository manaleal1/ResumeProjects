Projects on my resume.

### Movie Database
Used JDBC to create tables, load data into tables from .dat files, and used information in the database 
to create a query that provided the total number of ratings that were made for movies that were released 
in a given year. The years ranged from 1919 to 2000.

### Stock Watch
Developed an android application, programmed in Java, that retrieves and displays any stock information 
that the user requests.

### Eight Puzzle
This java program demonstrated the effectiveness of various search algorithms by using them to solve 
three eight puzzles with difficulties ranging from easy, medium, and hard. The search algorithms used 
were Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search, Uniform-Cost Search, (Greedy) Best-First Search, and two 
versions of A Star Search. 

### Dots and Boxes
Implemented a slightly modified text-based version of the Dots and Boxes game in Java. The user plays against 
a computer player. The computer player decides what move to make using an adversarial search algorithm.

### Chicago Linguistic Data
Group project. Utilized AJAX calls to obtain 2008-2012 census data. This data was used to create charts that 
informs users what non-English languages were spoken in the Chicago area, the number of individuals that spoke 
each language, and the distribution of languages spoken in each community.
